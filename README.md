# PyBot
A local F-Chat bot framework built with Python.

## Usage:
`python pybot.py`

**Note:** You do not need to create a passphrase or store your passphrase-encrypted (*SHA512*) password on the filesystem, but it will require you to input your username and password either via the login wizard, or via the `--username` and `--password` arguments.
